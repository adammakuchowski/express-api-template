# Express API TypeScript Template

The repository is a template that provides a ready-to-use structure and configuration for creating an API using Express.js and TypeScript. This template allows developers to quickly start working on a new project, offering the necessary tools and settings for writing safe and efficient code in a TypeScript environment. As a result, developers can focus on implementing business logic and functionalities, bypassing the setup of basic elements such as handling HTTP requests, data validation, route management.
